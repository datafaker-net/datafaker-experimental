# Datafaker Experimental

This repository is a place where more experimental ideas take place,
which may or may not make it into the core of the Datafaker project one day,
either in the main project or as a graduated module.

Probably needless so say, but the code in this repository is not stable, 
doesn't have the extensive test coverage as Datafaker has, and basically,
there is little guarantee this code actually works. 

I hope that's enough as a disclaimer for now.
